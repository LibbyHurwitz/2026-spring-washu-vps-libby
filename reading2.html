        Whenever I tell someone that I’m studying communication design, almost inevitably they will respond with something along the lines of “that’s cool. So how do you feel about AI?” Am I threatened? Scared? Excited? This new Turing test is a fantastic rubric with which to self-evaluate my own work and introduces a new framework through which to view the rise of AI. AI has become mainstream and with every new technology, has tremendous capabilities for both good and bad. I think this article provides a really refreshing and thoughtful way to reconsider the discussion around AI not in simple terms of good vs bad but by the quality of its product. In the age of AI, it is more critical than ever to be conscious consumers and even more intentional creators.
