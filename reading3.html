    I think this article takes a really interesting perspective on the progression of technology and how it is integrated with humanity. An overwhelming view I’ve heard is that the advancement of easily accessible technology is gradually corrupting what makes us human. TikToks and Instagram chipping away at our dismal attention spans, Elon Musk brain implants to help us control our thoughts, and other such cyborg technologies as mentioned in the article. What I think is very interesting is in his argument, Webb sees the person as the computer with technology being integrated into the body and cognition. The word of “rooms” as described by Webb sounds like something out of a sci fi novel and I don’t know how realistic it actually is, but what this new concept brings to the table is the idea that technology is not always intrusive. As opposed to feeling as though our new modifications are corrupting us, we could turn our attention toward how to enhance what is around us instead.
