        I must admit that I have personally never really payed attention to restaurant websites but I think of the medium of the restaurant website represents a unique challenge to translate a physical space into a digital product. I particularly thought the part where Toph defines a “good” restaurant website by if the “atmosphere” of the place comes across through the website. Specifically, how typography, color, and layout can effectively communicate the restaurants identity in digital form. I think it’s interesting to consider  the loss of the art of the restaurant website within the context of the development of modern website technology. While more easily accessible, it removes a level of novelty and expression that you would otherwise have if you design it on your own. Social media adds another interesting variable into the equation as while it has been very beneficial to small businesses, restaurants can become hyper dependent on it to attract customers and build their brand and with the ever evolving algorithms and trends, keeping up can be very hard to maintain. While I do not know what is in the future for the restaurant website, I know that after reading this article I will never take one for granted again.
